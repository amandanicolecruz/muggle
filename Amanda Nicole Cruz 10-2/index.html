				<h2>AUTHOR:J.K.ROWLING</h2>
				<h4>Joanne Rowling-the girl who grew up to write Harry Potter.</h4>
				<br>
				<p>Joanne Rowling was born on 31st July 1965.She, her sister and her parents lived in Winterbourne, Gloucestershire, until Joanne was nine, when the family moved to Tutshill, near Chepstow.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Joanne grew up surrounded by books as her mum and dad loved reading-she says, "I lived for books I was your basic common-or-garden bookworm, complete with freckles and National Health spectacles." From an early age Joanne wanted to be a writer. She wrote her first book at the age of six-a story about a rabbit called Rabbit. Then when she was eleven she wrote a novel about seven cursed diamonds and the people who owned them. </p>
				<br>
				<p>Her Classics studies would come in very handy later when she was thinking up all the spells in Harry Potter, some of which are based on Latin!J.K. Rowling first had the idea for Harry Potter while delayed on a train travelling from Manchester to London King's Cross in 1990. Over the next five years, she began to plan out the seven books of the series. She wrote mostly in longhand and amassed a mountain of notes, many of which were on scraps of paper. </p>
